Please enter the money you have in the `input box` `(in numbers)`

### mini_project 3

This project makes the article an Excel file by crawling on Naver when the user enters a keyword.
And if you make a person who will receive the mail with Excel in advance, you can read the Excel file and send the mail through gmail.

I coded the file to receive keywords and crawled titles from the user, create an email_list.xlsx file by creating a list in the file 미니프로젝트(3).py , and read the email_list.xlsx file and send mail to the user.

> how to run
1. If you don't have a `python` program, download it.
2. Open the `미니프로젝트 (3).py` file in the `mini_project3` folder.

5. Check your e-mail.
