### mini_project 1

> html, css

This project cloned the github header.

### mini_project 2

> js

This project is a product recommendation program by price.
I coded the getItemByAmount function.
This function compares the input value (money) and data (productlist) received from the user and returns the most expensive data that can be purchased as input values.
