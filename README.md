### mini_project 1

> html, css

This project cloned the github header.

### mini_project 2

> js

This project is a product recommendation program by price.
I coded the getItemByAmount function.
This function compares the input value (money) and data (productlist) received from the user and returns the most expensive data that can be purchased as input values.

### mini_project 3

> python

This project makes the article an Excel file by crawling on Naver when the user enters a keyword.
And if you make a person who will receive the mail with Excel in advance, you can read the Excel file and send the mail through gmail.

I coded the file to receive keywords and crawled titles from the user, create an email_list.xlsx file by creating a list in the file 미니프로젝트(3).py , and read the email_list.xlsx file and send mail to the user.
